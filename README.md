# Builder Design Pattern, in Swift 3.0

Using theory from [DZone: Builder Design Pattern](https://dzone.com/articles/design-patterns-the-builder-pattern)
and inspired on [github ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift](https://github.com/ochococo/Design-Patterns-In-Swift)

The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class controls the construction algorithm.

With this good practice, we will not get confuse when passing values on several parameters. And all necessary attributes will be initialized.
